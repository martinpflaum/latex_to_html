\section{Topological tensor products}
\label{sec:topological-tensor-products}
\begin{definition}[cf.~{\cite[Chap.~I, \S\,3, n$^\text{o}$\,3]{GroPTTEN}}]
  Let $\tvsV$ and $\tvsW$ be two locally convex topological vector spaces over the ground field $\fldK$. 
  A locally convex vector topology $\tau$ on the (algebraic) tensor product $\tvsV \otimes \tvsW$ 
  is called \emph{compatible with the tensor product structure}, an \emph{admissible tensor product topology}
  or just \emph{admissible}  if the following conditions hold true:
  \begin{axiomlist}[ATPT]
  \item
     The canonical map $\tvsV \times \tvsW  \to \tvsV \otimes_\tau \tvsW$ is seperately continuous
     that is  for each $v \in \tvsV$ and each $w\in\tvsW$ the linear maps 
     \[ \tvsW \to  \tvsV \otimes_\tau \tvsW, y \mapsto v \otimes y \quad\text{and} \quad
        \tvsV \to  \tvsV \otimes_\tau \tvsW, x \mapsto x \otimes w \]
     are continuous where $\tvsV \otimes_\tau \tvsW $ denotes the vector space 
     $\tvsV \otimes \tvsW$ equipped with $\tau$. 
  \item For all linear maps $\alpha \in \tvsV'$ and $\beta \in \tvsW'$ the canonical linear map 
     map $\alpha \otimes \beta :  \tvsV \otimes_\tau \tvsW \to  \fldK$
     is continuous. 
  \item For every equicontinuous subset $A \subset \tvsV'$ and equicontinuous subset $B\subset \tvsW'$
     the set $\left\{ \alpha \otimes \beta \mid \alpha \in A \:\&\: \beta \in B \right\}$ is an
     equicontinuous subset of the topological dual of $\tvsV \otimes_\tau \tvsW$. 
  \end{axiomlist}
  The locally convex vector topology $\tau$   
  is called \emph{strongly compatible with the tensor product structure}, 
  a \emph{strongly admissible tensor product topology} or briefly \emph{strongly admissible} 
  if it satisfies:
  \begin{axiomlist}[ATPT]
  \item[\textup{\sffamily (sATPT)}]
     The canonical map $\tvsV \times \tvsW  \to \tvsV \otimes_\tau \tvsW$ is continuous where
      $\tvsV \times \tvsW$ carries the product topology. 
  \end{axiomlist}
\end{definition}

\para
The admissible  respectively strongly admissible vector topologies on $ \tvsV \otimes \tvsW$ are obviously partially ordered 
by set-theoretic inclusion. Therefore, the following definition makes sense.
